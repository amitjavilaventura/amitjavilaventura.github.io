### Academic career

I begun my journey in science with a BSc in Biotechnology, during which I did a professional internship in a company dedicated to molecular and microbial analyses of food and water for pathogen detection and food forensics. I carried the bachelor's thesis in the same company by analyzing the microbial composition of the illeal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment. 

After graduating, I studied a MSc in Molecular Genetics, where I initiated to bioinformatics. During the thesis, I spent the whole year studying the role of the protein Xrn1 in nucleosome architecture and gene transcription in budding yeast. 

Then, I enrolled on an online MSc in Bioinformatics in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data. 

Recently, I moved to Milan to start a PhD in Computational Biology where I am collaborating in several projects studying epigenetics mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying cell differentiation and oncogenesis.

### Research interests

My research interests are mainly focused in the analysis of omics data related to the (epi)genomics field, as well as software development.

### Outside of academia

As a plus, I have been an active member from the *Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC)* -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (topics: job search, entrepreneurship, divulgation, research...) and leading the team in charge of communication and divulgation through social networks and our webpage.

Furthermore, one of my hobbies is communicating science and for this reason I have recently started [BioBit](https://biobit.netlify.app), a blog dedicated to spread Bioinformatics, and [Perill Biologic](https://perillbiologic.netlify.app), another blog to communicate Biology in catalan.

### In sport

On the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions.

I started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was *La Coupe de la Jeunesse* in 2011. In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men's double scull (BLM2x).

After many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7^th^ in the European Rowing Championship, just before starting the PhD. I haven't competed since then, but one cannot leave rowing that easily and I pretend to compete again at a more local level.
