In the context of my master's thesis (*MSc in Bioinformatics & Biostatsistics*), and under the suprevision of [Dr. Izaskun Mallona](https://imallona.bitbucket.io/), I decided to unravel the *ignorome* of colon cancer. The ignorome, defined by [Pandey *et al*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088889), consists in the genes that can be important in the biological context of a tissue or disease, but that haven't been well studied or related to that context because of publication biases or due to other reasons (see [Stoeger *et al*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2006643)).

<ins>My contributions to this research were:</ins>

* Analysis of microarray expression data from cancerous and normal colon samples (data from *GEO*).
* Build a list of CRC-specific genes and link them to publications using strinDB.
* Analysis of the interactivity of these genes.

* Build the colon cancer-related ignorome genes: analysis of microarray data from colon cancer and normal colon to define a list of genes putatively involved in colon cancer and linkage of that list to publications to define the ones that do not have any colon-related publication.
