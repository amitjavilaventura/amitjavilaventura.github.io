<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>My interests are mainly focused in the analysis of transcriptomics and epigenomics data, as well as in software and pipeline development. Currently, I am interested in small RNAs, more specifically piRNAs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I declare myself as an R and R Markdown lover, but I am in an open relationship with them, so I am eager to learn and use other languages such as Bash and Python.</p>

<h3>Academic career</h3>
<p>I began my journey in science with a BSc in Biotechnology, during which I did a professional internship in a company dedicated to molecular and microbial analyses of food and water for pathogen detection and food forensics. I carried the bachelor’s thesis in the same company by analyzing the microbial composition of the illeal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment.</p>
<p>After graduating, I studied a MSc in Molecular Genetics, where I initiated to bioinformatics. During the thesis, I spent the whole year studying the role of the protein Xrn1 in nucleosome architecture and gene transcription in budding yeast.</p>
<p>Then, I enrolled on a MSc in Bioinformatics in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data.</p>
<p>In 2019 I moved to Milan where I worked as a bioinformatician for two years. There, I collaborated in several projects studying epigenetic mechanisms and signaling pathways -mainly Wnt/<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>catenin- underlying cell differentiation and oncogenesis.</p>
<p>After two years, in August 2021, I returned to Catalunya to continue my career in bioinformatics at the <a href="https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en/regulatory-genomics">Regulatory Genomics group</a> in the <a href="https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en">Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute</a>, where I completed my master’s thesis and I worked as a computational biologist.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been awarded the <a href="https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/inphinit-doctoral-fellowships-incoming">INPhINIT Incoming PhD fellowship</a> from LaCaixa and I will start my PhD in Bioinformatics in the same institute, group and topic.</p>

<h3>Outside of academia</h3>
<p>As a plus, I have been an active member from the <a href="https://asbtec.cat"><em>Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC)</em></a> -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (e.g. job search, entrepreneurship, outreach, different research topics…) and leading the team in charge of communication through social networks, our webpage and other activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of my hobbies is communicating science and for this reason I have recently started <a href="https://biobit.netlify.app">BioBit</a>, a blog dedicated to spread Bioinformatics, although its main goal is to study about what I write. Also, I started <a href="https://perillbiologic.netlify.app">Perill Biologic</a>, another blog to disseminate basic Biology in Catalan.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been involved in outreach activities organized by the <a href="https://www.carrerasresearch.org/en">Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute</a></p>

<h3>In sport</h3>
<p>On the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions.</p>
<p>I started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was <em>La Coupe de la Jeunesse</em> in 2011. In 2013, in competed in my first World Rowing Under-23 Championship in the lightweight men’s single scull (BLM1x), in which I finished in the first position of the Final D (19<sup>th</sup>). In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the Olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men’s double scull (BLM2x). After many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7<sup>th</sup> in the European Rowing Championship, just before moving to Milan to work as a bioinformatician.</p>
<p>In the two years I was in Milan, i didn’t compete, but I have now returned to row at local level, as well as to practice other sports. Indeed, I have recently completed my first half marathon and I am training to participate in some trail running competitions.</p>
