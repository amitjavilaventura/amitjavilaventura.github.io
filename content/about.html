My career in science began with a BSc in Biotechnology (<em>Universitat de Girona</em>), in which I learned the basics of biological organisms and their modification and application to develop new and useful tools for the society. During this undergraduate studies, I did a professioanl internship in a company dedicated to the pathogen detection in water and food samples, as well as food forensics, using (q)PCR. I performed the thesis in the same company, under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gill, studying the microbial ecology in the illeal intestinal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and a ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment, gaining knowledge and experience in microbiology and basic statistics.

After graduating, I moved to Sevilla to study a MSc in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology (<em>Universidad de Sevilla</em>) and combine these studies with the training with the Spanish Rowing Team, located in the mentioned city. It was then when I first met bioinformatics, since in the master’s thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutiérrez Pozo, I studied the Xrn1 protein role in nucleosome architecture and transcription of budding yeast using a bioinformatics-based approach in which I analysed MNase-seq data and I performed several MNase-qPCR experiments to validate the results.

The following year, I enrolled an online MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (<em>Universitat Oberta de Catalunya</em>) in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data. Furthermore, I moved to Milan to work as a bioinformatician in the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, where I have been granted with the SEMM PhD Fellowship to do a 4-year PhD in Computational Biology, under the supervision of Dr. Diego Pasini.

As a plus, I have been an active member from the <em>Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC)</em> -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (topics: job search, entrepreneurship, divulgation, research…) and leading the team in charge of communication and divulgation through social networks and our webpage.

Furthermore, one of my hobbies is communicating science and for this reason I have recently started <a href="https://biobit.netlify.app">BioBit</a>, a blog dedicated to spread Bioinformatics.

On the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was <em>La Coupe de la Jeunesse</em> in 2011. In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men’s double scull (BLM2x).

After many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7<sup>th</sup> in the European Rowing Championship, just before starting the PhD. I haven’t competed since then, but one cannot leave rowing that easily and I pretend to compete again at a more local level.
