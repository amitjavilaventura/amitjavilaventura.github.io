## Goal

*chromHMMviewR* is an R package to visualize data from [ChromHMM](http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/). 

After running chromHMM, I always had problems to integrate the results in my reports, so I started developping some functions to visualize the heatmaps that chromHMM shows you, but using `ggplot2` instead. Finally, in order to practice the creation of R packages, I decided to follow [these guides](https://github.com/ASPteaching/2017-03-Rpackages_and_Github) to turn the functions into a package.
