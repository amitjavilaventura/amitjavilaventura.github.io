At the beggining of my academic career, I wanted to be a wetlab scientist and, in honor to the truth, I didn’t love bioinformatics, so I focussed my bachelor’s thesis in Molecular Microbiology. However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R. Then, due to sport-related reasons, I dedicated the master’s thesis to the study of yeast gene expression using bioinformatics-based approached. This is when I started to realize that computational biology wasn’t that bad and that I actually liked it.

Today I am working as a bioinformatician in an epigenetics group, mainly studying signal transduction and the mutations in the Wnt/<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>catenin signaling pathway.

My professional interests are related to the data analysis in support to experimental research, as well as the pure computational experimentation. Moreover, I am a big fan of open science and I try to have my code repositories (mainly GitHub) as open and updated as possible.

Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation -I have a <a href="https://biobit.netlify.app">blog</a> dedicated to spreading bioinformatics- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level- and cycling.
