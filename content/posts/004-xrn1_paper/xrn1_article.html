title: "I am not a virgin anymore!"
description: |
  Don't worry, I am not talking about my romantic life but I have been recently told that the article I had been working in during my master's thesis -around 2018-, has been officially published in RNA Biology under the title 'Xrn1 influence on gene transcription results from the combination of general effects on elongating RNA pol II and gene-specific chromatin configuration', being the first journal paper in which I appear in the authors list. Nevertheless, I am not going to explain this article, since I only worked in the MNase-seq data analysis, but... what is MNase-seq?
