<a href="https://biobit.netlify.app">BioBit</a> is a blog dedicated to spread and communicate bioinformatics to society. I made it using the R package <code>distill</code> and to publish it I used Netlify, because GitHub pages force me to have it as a subdomain of my personal website.
</p>
<p align="justify">
My goal with the blog is posting basic things and recent advances about bioinformatics, as well as some biology and computer science -although I wonâ€™t post much about it, since I am a bioscientist rather than a computer one-.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Moreover, I have also explained how I made the blog using Rmarkdown and <code>distill</code>, as well as the steps I followed to make my personal website using a simple Rmarkdown page and why I changed to a Distill Blog for it.

I wish that you will like what I have to say and you will have fun reading it.
