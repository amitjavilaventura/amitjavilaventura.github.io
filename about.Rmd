<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> My career in science began with a BSc in Biotechnology (*Universitat de Girona*), in which I learned the basics of biological organisms and their modification and application to develop new and useful tools for the society. During this undergraduate studies, I did a professioanl internship in a company dedicated to the pathogen detection in water and food samples, as well as food forensics, using (q)PCR. I performed the thesis in the same company, under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gill, studying the microbial ecology in the illeal intestinal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and a ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment, gaining knowledge and experience in microbiology and basic statistics. </p>

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> After graduating, I moved to Sevilla to study a MSc in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology (*Universidad de Sevilla*) and combine these studies with the training with the Spanish Rowing Team, located in the mentioned city. It was then when I first met bioinformatics, since in the master's thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutiérrez Pozo, I studied the Xrn1 protein role in nucleosome architecture and transcription of budding yeast using a bioinformatics-based approach in which I analysed MNase-seq data and I performed several MNase-qPCR experiments to validate the results. </p>

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> The following year, I enrolled an online MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (*Universitat Oberta de Catalunya*) in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data. Furthermore, I moved to Milan to work as a bioinformatician in the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, where I have been granted with the SEMM PhD Fellowship to do a 4-year PhD in Computational Biology, under the supervision of Dr. Diego Pasini. </p>

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> As a plus, I have been an active member from the *Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC)* -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (topics: job search, entrepreneurship, divulgation, research...) and leading the team in charge of communication and divulgation through social networks and our webpage.</p>

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> On the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions.   </p>

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> I started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was *La Coupe de la Jeunesse* in 2011. In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men's double scull (BLM2x).   </p>

knitr::include_graphics("assets/after_wru23c2016.png")
```

<p style='font-size:15px;' align='justify'> After many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7^th^ in the European Rowing Championship, just before starting the PhD. I haven't competed since then, but one cannot leave rowing that easily and I pretend to compete again at a more local level. </p>
