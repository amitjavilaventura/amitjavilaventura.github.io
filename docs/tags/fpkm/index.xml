When analyzing RNA-seq data and studying gene expression levels, we usually start from counts, which are sequencing reads mapped to genomic features such as genes. However, using counts as they are to compare different samples (gene A in sample 1 vs gene A in sample 2) or even genes within a sample (gene is not a good option, since the amount of counts in a gene will vary a lot depending on how much the sample has been sequenced (sequencing depth; different between samples) and the length of the gene (different between genes): the more reads mapped in a sample, the more counts the genes in that sample will have, and the longer a gene is, the more counts will it have.</description>
