      <description>Figure 1: Figure 1 of the article showing the model of how Xrn1 and other RNA decay factors work. Source: Begley V et al (2020). Xrn1 influence on gene transcription results from the combination of general effects on elongating RNA pol II and gene-specific chromatin configuration. RNA Biology. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1845504.  If you want to know more about it, read my post in BioBit. The article can be found at:  Begley V et al (2020).</description>

      <description>What is DNAme? DNAme is an application for teaching/learning purposes which converts a word to a DNA sequence. It has some theory to understand the processes underlying this conversion, but this theroy must not be used with teaching puroposes because it may have some inaccuracies. 
 How DNAme works? Summary DNAme was designed using R/Shiny that takes your name as a sequence of one-letter aminoacids and converts them to DNA/mRNA by looking for the codon that codes for each aminoacid.</description>

      <description>BioBit is a blog dedicated to spread and communicate bioinformatics to society. I made it using the R package distill and to publish it I used Netlify, because GitHub pages force me to have it as a subdomain of my personal website. My goal with the blog is posting basic things and recent advances about bioinformatics, as well as some biology and computer science -although I won’t post much about it, since I am a bioscientist rather than a computer one-.</description>

      <description>At the beggining of my academic career, I wanted to be a wetlab scientist and, in honor to the truth, I didn’t love bioinformatics, so I focussed my bachelor’s thesis in Molecular Microbiology. However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R.</description>
