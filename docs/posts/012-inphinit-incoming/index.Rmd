I am very happy! I have recently been awarded with the [INPhINIT Incoming PhD fellowship](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/inphinit-doctoral-fellowships-incoming), a prestigious fellowship awarded by LaCaixa.

It has been 6 months of preparing documentation, writing letters and passing distinct selection processes, including an interview.
