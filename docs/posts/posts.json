    "description": "Don't worry, I am not talking about my romantic life but I have been recently told that the article I had been working in during my master's thesis -around 2018-, has been officially published in RNA Biology under the title 'Xrn1 influence on gene transcription results from the combination of general effects on elongating RNA pol II and gene-specific chromatin configuration', being the first journal paper in which I appear in the authors list. Nevertheless, I am not going to explain this article, since I only worked in the MNase-seq data analysis, but... what is MNase-seq?",

    "description": "Would you like to have your name in DNA format? Try this funny app made using R and Shiny that converts your name to a sequence of DNA or mRNA. To do so, DNAme takes each letter of your name as a one-letter code aminoacid and then, it looks for the codon that codes for that aminoacid. It is possible to choose between DNA or mRNA nucleotides, as well as, using the codon usage of diverse organisms. Nevertheless, there are some letters (i.e. B, Ç, J, U, X, ...) that are not associated to any aminoacid and hence, names containing these letters cannot be transformed to DNA nor mRNA.",

It has some theory to understand the processes underlying this conversion, but this theroy must not be used with teaching puroposes because it may have some inaccuracies.\nHow DNAme works?\nSummary\nDNAme was designed using R/Shiny that takes your name as a sequence of one-letter aminoacids and converts them to DNA/mRNA by looking for the codon that codes for each aminoacid.\nOne-letter code for aminoacids\nSince most aminoacids are coded by more than one codon, it takes the codon usage of several species into account, selecting the most frequent codon based on genescript’s codon frequency tables. Currently the available organisms are human and mouse, but the idea is to have some of the most used model organisms (i.e. A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, E. coli, …).\nNot all names\nIt has to be taken into account that not all names can be converted to DNA/mRNA, because not all letters have an associated aminoacid. Hence, if a letter in your name is not possible, DNAme will throw an error message. You have two possibilites:\nChoose another word, such as a nickname or a surname.\nPlay with phonetics. For example, if your name contains an X you could change it by a combination of letters with a similar sound like KS, which are Lysine and Serine.\nParameters\nDNAme allows to select diverse parameters:\nNucleic acid: DNA or mRNA\nOrganism (for the codon usage): Human or Mouse\nSeparator: character to separate the codons (i.e. a dash, a blank space, nothing).\nin the future Use extra letters.\nAvailability\nDNAme is available here as a working application. This version is deployed to shinyapps.io and only one person at a time can be connected to the app.\nTo download the source code, go to the Github repository and clone it. Then open R or RStudio, go to the DNAme directory (with setwd()) and run shiny::runApp(\"app.R\") in the R console. In this case you will need to install some R packages:\nshiny\ndplyr\nmagrittr\nstringr\nIn the future, I want to build it as a Desktop app using photon, but at the moment, this option is not available.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nAt the beggining of my academic career, I wanted to be a wetlab scientist and, in honor to the truth, I didn’t love bioinformatics, so I focussed my bachelor’s thesis in Molecular Microbiology. However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R. Then, due to sport-related reasons, I dedicated the master’s thesis to the study of yeast gene expression using bioinformatics-based approached. This is when I started to realize that computational biology wasn’t that bad and that I actually liked it.\n\n\nToday I am working as a bioinformatician in an epigenetics group, mainly studying signal transduction and the mutations in the Wnt pathway, to which I will dedicate my PhD project.\n\n\nMy professional interests are related to the data analysis in support to experimental research, as well as the pure computational experimentation. Moreover, I am a big fan of open science and I try to have my code repositories (mainly GitHub) as open and updated as possible.\n\n\nApart from science, I love scientific divulgation -I have a blog dedicated to spreading bioinformatics- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level- and cycling.\n\nI hope you enjoy this website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
