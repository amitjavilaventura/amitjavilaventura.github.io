[{"categories":null,"content":"My career in science began with a BSc in Biotechnology (Universitat de Girona), in which I learned the basics of biological organisms and their modification and application to develop new and useful tools for the society. During this undergraduate studies, I did a professioanl internship in a company dedicated to the pathogen detection in water and food samples, as well as food forensics, using (q)PCR. I performed the thesis in the same company, under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gill, studying the microbial ecology in the illeal intestinal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and a ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment, gaining knowledge and experience in microbiology and basic statistics. After graduating, I moved to Sevilla to study a MSc in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology (Universidad de Sevilla) and combine these studies with the training with the Spanish Rowing Team, located in the mentioned city. It was then when I first met bioinformatics, since in the master’s thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutiérrez Pozo, I studied the Xrn1 protein role in nucleosome architecture and transcription of budding yeast using a bioinformatics-based approach in which I analysed MNase-seq data and I performed several MNase-qPCR experiments to validate the results. The following year, I enrolled an online MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data. Furthermore, I moved to Milan to work as a bioinformatician in the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, where I have been granted with the SEMM PhD Fellowship to do a 4-year PhD in Computational Biology, under the supervision of Dr. Diego Pasini. As a plus, I have been an active member from the Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC) -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (topics: job search, entrepreneurship, divulgation, research…) and leading the team in charge of communication and divulgation through social networks and our webpage.

On the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions I started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was La Coupe de la Jeunesse in 2011. In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men’s double scull (BLM2x).

After many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7^th^ in the European Rowing Championship, just before starting the PhD. I haven't competed since then, but one cannot leave rowing that easily and I pretend to compete again at a more local level.","date":"2021-02-01","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":" body {text-align: justify} Pipelines ","date":"2021-02-01","objectID":"/development/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Code","uri":"/development/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Snakemake ATACseq pipeline ongoing Simple Snakemake pipeline for ATACseq used in Pasini’s lab.

However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R. Then, due to sport-related reasons, I dedicated the master’s thesis to the study of yeast gene expression using bioinformatics-based approached. This is when I started to realize that computational biology wasn’t that bad and that I actually liked it. Today I am working as a bioinformatician in an epigenetics group, mainly studying signal transduction and the mutations in the Wnt pathway, to which I will dedicate my PhD project. My professional interests are related to the data analysis in support to experimental research, as well as the pure computational experimentation. Moreover, I am a big fan of open science and I try to have my code repositories (mainly GitHub) as open and updated as possible. Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation -I have a blog dedicated to spreading bioinformatics- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level- and cycling. I hope you enjoy this website.

Using MNase-seq and following a DANPOS-based analysis, we found that the Xrn1 knockout mutant strains had higher nucleosome occupancy around TSS, which we related with a lower transcription initiation compared to WT strains, whereas in the gene body, the nucleosome occupancy was diminished as a consequence of RNA pol II backtracking. Results were validated using MNase-qPCR of two selected genes in Xrn1 conditional mutants. My contribution to this research was: Performing the bioinformatic analysis of the MNase-seq data. Performing the MNase-qPCR validation, including the yeast culture, the MNase-driven DNA digestion, the design of the primers and the following qPCRs.

September 2016 - June 2017 Internship and Bachelor's thesis student In the context of the bachelor's thesis (Universitat de Girona) and under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gil, I studied the diversity of the ileal mucosa-related microbiota of colorectal cancer patients submitted to an ileostomy and its changes after a butyrate treatment. Using DNA extracted from human biopsies of ileal mucosa, we performed qPCR and high-throughput sequencing followed by a SPSS-based statistical analysis of to test the differences between the butyrate-treated, placebo-treated and untreated groups, and we found that some healthy-related butyrate-producing bacteria increased in proportion after the butyrate-treated, but not in the other groups. At the same time, different disease-related bacteria were found to decrease in the butyrate group after the treatment compared to the other groups. Although the changes weren't higly robust in terms of significancy, the short-period of the treatment (4 weeks) and its conditions (ileostomy allows oxigen to enter the ileum, which is supposed to be an anoxic environment) made us think that a long-term butyrate treatment could improve microbiological conditions in the studied patients. My contribution to this research was: Performing the DNA extractions of the intestinal biopsies. Performing qPCR analyses to detect and quantify some of the crucial bacterial families and genders. Performing the SPSS-based statistical analysis for the high-throughput sequencing-derived data.
