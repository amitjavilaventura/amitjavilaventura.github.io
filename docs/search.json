      "contents": "\n\nMy career in science began with a BSc in Biotechnology (Universitat de Girona), in which I learned the basics of biological organisms and their modification and application to develop new and useful tools for the society. During this undergraduate studies, I did a professioanl internship in a company dedicated to the pathogen detection in water and food samples, as well as food forensics, using (q)PCR. I performed the thesis in the same company, under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gill, studying the microbial ecology in the illeal intestinal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and a ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment, gaining knowledge and experience in microbiology and basic statistics.\n\n\nAfter graduating, I moved to Sevilla to study a MSc in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology (Universidad de Sevilla) and combine these studies with the training with the Spanish Rowing Team, located in the mentioned city. It was then when I first met bioinformatics, since in the master’s thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutiérrez Pozo, I studied the Xrn1 protein role in nucleosome architecture and transcription of budding yeast using a bioinformatics-based approach in which I analysed MNase-seq data and I performed several MNase-qPCR experiments to validate the results.\n\n\nThe following year, I enrolled an online MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) in which I am learning the basic tools and statistical knowledge behind the analyses of large amounts of biological data. Furthermore, I moved to Milan to work as a bioinformatician in the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, where I have been granted with the SEMM PhD Fellowship to do a 4-year PhD in Computational Biology, under the supervision of Dr. Diego Pasini.\n\n\nAs a plus, I have been an active member from the Associació de Biotecnòlegs de Catalunya (ASBTEC) -an association dedicated to promotion of the biotechnologists to Catalan society- since 2018 and board member since 2019, collaborating in the organization of diverse Biotechnology-related events (topics: job search, entrepreneurship, divulgation, research…) and leading the team in charge of communication and divulgation through social networks and our webpage.\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:jd_asbtec_19_20)Members of ASBTEC’s Directive Board (2019-2020). I am the one on the right side of the photo.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, one of my hobbies is communicating science and for this reason I have recently started BioBit, a blog dedicated to spread Bioinformatics.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: BioBit logo. Source: biobit.netlify.app.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, during most of my academic career, I have combined the science studies with high-level training and competition in rowing, achieving excellent results in both, national and international competitions.\n\n\nI started rowing in 2007 and my first international competition was La Coupe de la Jeunesse in 2011. In 2016, together with my double mate, I missed the olympic qualification for only one place and, after that, we became World Rowing Under-23 Champions in the lightweight men’s double scull (BLM2x).\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:after_wru23c2016)My crewmate, my coach and me after winning the 2016 World Rowing Under-23 Championship in the lightweight men’s double scull.\n\n\n\n\nAfter many years training at my highest level, I left elite rowing in 2019, after being 7th in the European Rowing Championship, just before starting the PhD. I haven’t competed since then, but one cannot leave rowing that easily and I pretend to compete again at a more local level.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Using MNase-seq and following a DANPOS-based analysis, we found that the Xrn1 knockout mutant strains had higher nucleosome occupancy around TSS, which we related with a lower transcription initiation compared to WT strains, whereas in the gene body, the nucleosome occupancy was diminished as a consequence of RNA pol II backtracking. Results were validated using MNase-qPCR of two selected genes in Xrn1 conditional mutants.\n\n\nMy contribution to this research was:\n\n\nPerforming the bioinformatic analysis of the MNase-seq data.\n\n\nPerforming the MNase-qPCR validation, including the yeast culture, the MNase-driven DNA digestion, the design of the primers and the following qPCRs.\n\n\nMaster’s thesis:\n\n Influence of Xrn1 in nucleosome positioning across Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome and its effects in transcription.\n\n\nRelated publications:\n\n\nBegley et al (2020).

Using DNA extracted from human biopsies of ileal mucosa, we performed qPCR and high-throughput sequencing followed by a SPSS-based statistical analysis of to test the differences between the butyrate-treated, placebo-treated and untreated groups, and we found that some healthy-related butyrate-producing bacteria increased in proportion after the butyrate-treated, but not in the other groups. At the same time, different disease-related bacteria were found to decrease in the butyrate group after the treatment compared to the other groups. Although the changes weren’t higly robust in terms of significancy, the short-period of the treatment (4 weeks) and its conditions (ileostomy allows oxigen to enter the ileum, which is supposed to be an anoxic environment) made us think that a long-term butyrate treatment could improve microbiological conditions in the studied patients.\n\n\nMy contribution to this research was:\n\n\nPerforming the DNA extractions of the intestinal biopsies.\n\n\nPerforming qPCR analyses to detect and quantify some of the crucial bacterial families and genders.\n\n\nPerforming the SPSS-based statistical analysis for the high-throughput sequencing-derived data.\n\n\nPerforming qPCR analyses to detect and quantify some of the species found to be increased in the sequencing data.\n\n\nBachelor’s thesis:\n\n Butyrate-induced changes in the diversity of intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota in colorectal cancer patients submitted to a lateral ileostomy. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
