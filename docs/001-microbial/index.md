<p align='justify'> In the context of the bachelor's thesis (<i>Universitat de Girona</i>) and under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gil, I studied the diversity of the ileal mucosa-related microbiota of colorectal cancer patients submitted to an ileostomy and its changes after a butyrate treatment. Using DNA extracted from human biopsies of ileal mucosa, we performed qPCR and high-throughput sequencing followed by a SPSS-based statistical analysis of to test the differences between the butyrate-treated, placebo-treated and untreated groups, and we found that some healthy-related butyrate-producing bacteria increased in proportion after the butyrate-treated, but not in the other groups. At the same time, different disease-related bacteria were found to decrease in the butyrate group after the treatment compared to the other groups. Although the changes weren't higly robust in terms of significancy, the short-period of the treatment (4 weeks) and its conditions (ileostomy allows oxigen to enter the ileum, which is supposed to be an anoxic environment) made us think that a long-term butyrate treatment could improve microbiological conditions in the studied patients.</p>
