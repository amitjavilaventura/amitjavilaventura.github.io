With the goal of completing a PhD thesis, I have been involved in the analysis of transcriptomics and epigenomics data to study the effects of mutations on the Wnt pathway that stabilize &beta;catenin, constitutively overactivate the pathway and cause mouse organoids and stem cells from small intestine acquire adenoma-like phenotype and characteristics.

<p align='justify'>
* Comparison of different ATACseq peak callers. <br>
* Comparison of different sequencing depths in RNAseq. <br>
* Development of an ATACseq pipeline to run using Snakemake. The code can be visualized [here](https://github.com/amitjavilaventura/ATACseq-snakemake) (still ongoing). <br>
* Development of a ShinyApp to allow wetlab members to visualize the omics produced in the lab in an easy way. The code can be visualized [here](https://github.com/amitjavilaventura/DPomics). <br>
* Analysis of transcriptomics (RNAseq), cistromics (ChIPseq) and DNA accessibility data (ATACseq). <br>

<!--
* Analysis of the CRC-related ignorome.
