During my stage in Dr. Diego Pasini's lab, I am investigating several molecular signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation and oncogenesis.

<ins>My contributions to this research were:</ins>

* Comparison of different ATAC-seq peak callers. <br>
* Comparison of different sequencing depths in RNA-seq. <br>
* Development of an ATAC-seq pipeline to run using Snakemake. The code can be visualized [here](https://github.com/amitjavilaventura/ATACseq-snakemake) (still ongoing). <br>
* Development of a ShinyApp to allow wetlab members to visualize the omics produced in the lab in an easy way. The code can be visualized [here](https://github.com/amitjavilaventura/DPomics). <br>
* Analysis of bulk RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. <br>
