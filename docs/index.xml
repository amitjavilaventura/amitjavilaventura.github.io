      <description>Pasini’s lab, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia July 2019 - Present
Bioinformatician During my stage in Dr. Diego Pasini’s lab, I am investigating several molecular signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation and oncogenesis.
 My contributions to this research were:   Comparison of different ATAC-seq peak callers.  Comparison of different sequencing depths in RNA-seq.  Development of an ATAC-seq pipeline to run using Snakemake. The code can be visualized here (still ongoing).</description>

      <description>Computational Biology, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya March 2021 - Present
Master’s thesis student In the context of my master’s thesis (MSc in Bioinformatics &amp;amp; Biostatsistics), and under the suprevision of Dr. Izaskun Mallona, I decided to unravel the ignorome of colon cancer. The ignorome, defined by Pandey et al, consists in the genes that can be important in the biological context of a tissue or disease, but that haven’t been well studied or related to that context because of publication biases or due to other reasons (see Stoeger et al).</description>

      <description>Gene expression lab, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla September 2017 - October 2018
Master’s thesis student and research assistant In the context of the master’s thesis (Universidad de Sevilla), under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutierrez Pozo and within Dr. Victoria Begley’s PhD project, I started studying Xrn1, a protein involved in the degradation of mRNA, and it’s role in the nucleosome localization and transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</description>

      <description>Intestinal microbial ecology, Microbial, S.L. September 2016 - June 2017
Internship and Bachelor’s thesis student In the context of the bachelor’s thesis (Universitat de Girona) and under the supervision of Prof. Jesús García-Gil, I studied the diversity of the ileal mucosa-related microbiota of colorectal cancer patients submitted to an ileostomy and its changes after a butyrate treatment. Using DNA extracted from human biopsies of ileal mucosa, we performed qPCR and high-throughput sequencing followed by a SPSS-based statistical analysis of to test the differences between the butyrate-treated, placebo-treated and untreated groups, and we found that some healthy-related butyrate-producing bacteria increased in proportion after the butyrate-treated, but not in the other groups.</description>

      <description>Adrià Mitjavila on March 23, 2021  Look at the source code here.
Goal chromHMMviewR is an R package to visualize data from ChromHMM.
After running chromHMM, I always had problems to integrate the results in my reports, so I started developping some functions to visualize the heatmaps that chromHMM shows you, but using ggplot2 instead. Finally, in order to practice the creation of R packages, I decided to follow these guides to turn the functions into a package.</description>

      <description>Adrià Mitjavila on March 5, 2021  DPomics: DP lab omics data visualization and integration.
Look at the source code here.
Goal DPomics is a ShinyAPP to visualize omics data coming from the analysis we do in our lab.
It has been made in order to be easy for the wetlab members to use it, hence I would like to deploy it to shinyapps.io, like I have done with DNAme.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: Figure 1 of the article showing the model of how Xrn1 and other RNA decay factors work. Source: Begley V et al (2020). Xrn1 influence on gene transcription results from the combination of general effects on elongating RNA pol II and gene-specific chromatin configuration. RNA Biology. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1845504.  If you want to know more about it, read my post in BioBit. The article can be found at:  Begley V et al (2020).</description>

      <description>What is DNAme? DNAme is an application for teaching/learning purposes which converts a word to a DNA sequence. It has some theory to understand the processes underlying this conversion, but this theroy must not be used with teaching puroposes because it may have some inaccuracies. 
 How DNAme works? Summary DNAme was designed using R/Shiny that takes your name as a sequence of one-letter aminoacids and converts them to DNA/mRNA by looking for the codon that codes for each aminoacid.</description>

      <description>BioBit is a blog dedicated to spread and communicate bioinformatics to society. I made it using the R package distill and to publish it I used Netlify, because GitHub pages force me to have it as a subdomain of my personal website. My goal with the blog is posting basic things and recent advances about bioinformatics, as well as some biology and computer science -although I won’t post much about it, since I am a bioscientist rather than a computer one-.</description>

      <description>At the beggining of my academic career, I wanted to be a wetlab scientist and, in honor to the truth, I didn’t love bioinformatics, so I focussed my bachelor’s thesis in Molecular Microbiology. However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R.</description>

      <description>Research interests My research interests are mainly focused in the analysis of transcriptomics and epigenomics omics data related, as well as in software and pipeline development.
 Academic career I begun my journey in science with a BSc in Biotechnology, during which I did a professional internship in a company dedicated to molecular and microbial analyses of food and water for pathogen detection and food forensics. I carried the bachelor’s thesis in the same company by analyzing the microbial composition of the illeal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients submitted to a colectomy and ileostomy in response to a butyrate treatment.</description>
