<p align='justify'>In the context of the master's thesis (<i>Universidad de Sevilla</i>), under the supervision of Dr. Sebastián Chávez de Diego and Dr. Gabriel Gutierrez Pozo and within Dr. Victoria Begley's PhD project, I started studying Xrn1, a protein involved in the degradation of mRNA, and it's role in the nucleosome localization and transcription in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Using MNase-seq and following a DANPOS-based analysis, we found that the Xrn1 knockout mutant strains had higher nucleosome occupancy around TSS, which we related with a lower transcription initiation compared to WT strains, whereas in the gene body, the nucleosome occupancy was diminished as a consequence of RNA pol II backtracking. Results were validated using MNase-qPCR of two selected genes in Xrn1 conditional mutants. </p>
