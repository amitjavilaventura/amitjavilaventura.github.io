> **uBlogger** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).


It is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt).

Since the three themes have a similar look, if you have questions about their differences,
read [Why choose uBlogger](#why-choose-ublogger) so that you can choose the one that works best for you.
