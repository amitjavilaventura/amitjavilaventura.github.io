title: "Biotechnologist around computers"
description: |
  I am a former biotechnologist living around computers and, nowadays, I am working in an Epigenetics group seeking to get a PhD in Computational Biology. Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level- and cycling.

<p align='justify'> At the beggining of my academic career, I wanted to be a wetlab scientist and, in honor to the truth, I didn't love bioinformatics, so I focussed my bachelor's thesis in Molecular Microbiology. However, I noticed how crucial informatics-based analyses of biological data are when we externally sequenced and processed our metagenomics data and when I had to make the statistical analysis all by myself without knowing any R. Then, due to sport-related reasons, I dedicated the master's thesis to the study of yeast gene expression using bioinformatics-based approached. This is when I started to realize that computational biology wasn't that bad and that I actually liked it. </p>

<p align='justify'> Today I am working as a bioinformatician in an epigenetics group, mainly studying signal transduction and the mutations in the Wnt pathway, to which I will dedicate my PhD project.</p>

<p align='justify'>My professional interests are related to the data analysis in support to experimental research, as well as the pure computational experimentation. Moreover, I am a big fan of open science and I try to have my code repositories (mainly GitHub) as open and updated as possible.</p>

<p align='justify'>Apart from science, I love scientific divulgation  -I have a [blog](https://biobit.netlify.app) dedicated to spreading bioinformatics- and practicing sport, specially rowing -sport in which I competed at international level- and cycling.</p>

I hope you enjoy this website.
